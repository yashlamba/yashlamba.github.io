Me and a friend tinkered a bit with Flutter and decided that we can learn it on the go while building something. Flutter seemed quite easy to learn, efficient to use and a perfect fit for me since I had only worked with backend projects and libraries until then. It was a magical technology which would unlock the access to building beautiful UIs without the hassle of CSS and that too on any device! I can talk hours about Flutter but this is about Simulate. So me and the friend searched for some projects and saw a common pattern of people recommending to build a mathematical/algorithmic simulation. We then thought, why not build a collection on these!\nSo we started looking for inspiration and built the basic UI. I remember watching coding challenges on The Coding Train YouTube channel, that series was an integral part of this project (Thanks, Daniel Shiffman and The Coding Train). We started with Bubble sort and the Toothpick Pattern, and it worked out so great! We loved the process and kept looking for more inspiration.\nWe added more simulations, overhauled the UI a couple of times, added ability to favorite and search simulations and introduced Dark Mode! It wasn\u0026rsquo;t just me and my friend, so many other people collaborated on the project and it was amazing.\nWe also got selected in GirlScript Summer of Code in 2020, 21 and had a great time mentoring people who wanted to contribute to the project. I administered the project in 2020 followed by my Junior Yashu Garg in 2020.\nThe project was a huge confidence booster for me and I show it off really often. Simulate now has 10 beautiful simulations. Even though I don\u0026rsquo;t actively maintain/build it anymore, I am more than happy to help people who want to contribute/learn/take it further :)\n  GitHub: builtree/simulate\nDocs: Simulate Docs\nLive Project: Check it Out!\nThanks: Saksham, Yashu, Akshansh, Kartikey and other amazing OSS contributors!\n  ","permalink":"https://yashlamba.github.io/projects/simulate/","summary":"This post doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain much about simulate, rather my experience of building it.

Because it’s a good intro project to any new language or framework. I have built it with Python, C++, Javascript, and Dart (Flutter). I frequently use it as an example when I’m teaching someone the basics of a language/framework.\nIn this tutorial, we’ll build the Snake Game with Flutter. Some interesting things we’ll cover:\n Object-Oriented Design No frameworks - No game engines or third party libraries Flaws and Future Follow Ups  Things that aren’t covered well:\n Structuring a Flutter project - We’ll do it in one single file (executable on dartpad.dev) UI/UX - No menu, UI, glyphs, etc. Scoring - Because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t add value to project.  Let’s start:\nFor any simple single-player game, I usually start by thinking the following, step by step:\n Objects: What are the moving parts of the game, and which objects matter for building the MPG (Minimum Playable Game). In our game, they are the Snake and it\u0026rsquo;s food. State: The state of the game and connecting the objects. In the snake game, the state is a grid, wherein the snake and food will be. We’ll draw these using simple containers. Update State: The snake has to continually move forward which is a periodic update, and based on this (and the user input) the objects will have to respond to different states like snake eating the food, snake biting itself, snake hitting the wall, changing direction, etc. Controls: User controls; In our case, change the direction of the snake based on input (arrow keys to set the direction). Score: Score calculation and reset - number of food eaten. (not implemented in this tutorial though)  So having these things sorted, let’s code!\nFoundation We start with a stateless widget SnakeGame to define our MaterialApp. Followed by a stateful widget Game which would render our game and manage the State.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37  import \u0026#39;package:flutter/material.dart\u0026#39;;  void main() {  runApp(const SnakeGame()); }  class SnakeGame extends StatelessWidget {  const SnakeGame({Key? key}) : super(key: key);   @override  Widget build(BuildContext context) {  return const MaterialApp(  title: \u0026#34;Snake Game\u0026#34;,  home: Center(  child: Game(),  ),  );  } }  class Game extends StatefulWidget {  const Game({Key? key}) : super(key: key);   @override  State\u0026lt;Game\u0026gt; createState() =\u0026gt; _GameState(); }  class _GameState extends State\u0026lt;Game\u0026gt; {  @override  Widget build(BuildContext context) {  return Container(  width: 500, // Update with constants in next step  height: 500, // Update with constants in next step  color: Colors.black,  ); \t} }   Since we’ll need a few constants, let’s define a Constants class to access/modify them easily. Right now, we need 2 constants, canvasSize (height and width of the canvas) and blockSize (size of 1 block) so that we can imagine our canvas as a grid of side canvasSize/blockSize elements.\n1 2 3 4 5  class Constants {  // Canvas  static const double canvasSize = 500;  static const double blockSize = 10; }   After replacing height and width in the GameState with Constants.canvasSize we have a 50x50 imaginary grid to work with.\n Empty Canvas\n  Models/Objects Let\u0026rsquo;s start with our Snake; To represent the snake we’ll use a List of 2D points, and the number of points increases when the snake eats food. The first element of the list will be the location of the head and the last element, the tail. A point is just x, y values on a grid and for that, we’ll use dart’s Point class (imported from dart:math).\nWe also need a direction to represent in which direction the snake is moving, this can also be represented using a Point object since we just need to update the head of the snake along a certain axis, i.e. certain x, y values. We can add these directions to the constants and define our snake:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  class Constants {  // Canvas  static const double canvasSize = 500;  static const double blockSize = 10;   // Directions  static const up = Point(0, -1);  static const down = Point(0, 1);  static const right = Point(1, 0);  static const left = Point(-1, 0); }  class Snake {  List\u0026lt;Point\u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\u0026gt; snake = [const Point(0, 0)];  Point\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; direction = Constants.right;   Point\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; get head {  return snake[0];  } }   Now, we can add a snake object to our GameState along with the food, which also can be just a Point. In the below code, we introduce some things:\n random: To generate random numbers (random food locations). initGame: To initialize the Snake object and food location. foodUpdate: To update food location.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  class _GameState extends State\u0026lt;Game\u0026gt; { \tlate Snake snake; \tlate Point\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; food; \tRandom random = Random(); \t\t@override \tvoid initState() { \tinitGame(); \tsuper.initState(); \t} \t\tinitGame() { \tsnake = Snake(); \tfoodUpdate(); \t} \t\tvoid foodUpdate() { \tfood = Point(random.nextInt(Constants.canvasSize ~/ Constants.blockSize), \trandom.nextInt(Constants.canvasSize ~/ Constants.blockSize)); \t} \t\t@override \tWidget build(BuildContext context) { \treturn Container( \twidth: Constants.canvasSize, \theight: Constants.canvasSize, \tcolor: Colors.black, \t); \t} }   Now we are more or less done with the foundation code, we just need to paint the snake and food on the canvas. For that, we’ll use Stack and Positioned Widgets. Positioned puts a widget to provided locations in a Stack. We’ll use the properties, top and left to set y and x of the widget respectively.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  Widget build(BuildContext context) {  return Container(  width: Constants.canvasSize,  height: Constants.canvasSize,  color: Colors.black,  child: Stack(  children: snake.snake  .map((e) =\u0026gt; Positioned(  top: Constants.blockSize * e.y,  left: Constants.blockSize * e.x,  child: Container(  height: Constants.blockSize,  width: Constants.blockSize,  color: Colors.green,  ),  ))  .toList() +  [  Positioned(  top: Constants.blockSize * food.y,  left: Constants.blockSize * food.x,  child: Container(  height: Constants.blockSize,  width: Constants.blockSize,  color: Colors.red,  ),  )  ],  ),  ); }   In the above code, we basically created a Positioned Widget for each part of the snake and added a food object as well to that list.\n Painting Snake and Food\n  Update State Let’s make the game alive now. We want to periodically update the state of the canvas and for that, we can use Timer.periodic (imported from dart:async) which calls a function after certain Duration periodically.\nWe can add it to the initState which gets called once our game starts. We also need an update function, which is passed as a callback to Timer.periodic and is responsible for updating the game state.\nBefore implementing this gameUpdate function, let’s see what we actually need to update:\n Move the snake in a particular direction Check if the snake’s head overlaps with food  if yes, eat food, add length to the snake, and call foodUpdate   Check if the snake’s head overlapped with any other body part, if yes, reset the game.  Implementation (added to GameState):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  @override void initState() {  initGame();  Timer.periodic(const Duration(milliseconds: 50), (t) {  gameUpdate();  });  super.initState(); }  void gameUpdate() {  // update this  if (food == snake.head) {  snake.eatFood();  foodUpdate();  } else {  snake.update();  }  if (snake.didBiteItself()) {  initGame();  }  setState(() {}); }   Added to Snake Class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27  bool didBiteItself() {  for (int i = 1; i \u0026lt; snake.length; i++) {  if (snake[i] == head) {  return true;  }  }  return false; }  void update() {  // For moving in a direction, move all body parts to the location of the  // part before them  for (int i = snake.length - 1; i \u0026gt; 0; --i) {  snake[i] = snake[i - 1];  }  // Then update in the direction snake is moving \t// Mod 50 because, we want the snake to wrap when hitting a wall  snake[0] = Point((head.x + direction.x) % 50, (head.y + direction.y) % 50); }  void eatFood() {  // Since food is added to the end and snake would ultimately  // Update one position, save the last location and append it again.  var foodLoc = snake.last;  update();  snake.add(foodLoc); }   At this point, our game starts working (not controllable though). One bug I would like to address is that our foodUpdate might add the food on the snake\u0026rsquo;s body, so let\u0026rsquo;s add a check for that.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  // In the Stateful Widget void foodUpdate() {  do {  food = Point(random.nextInt(Constants.canvasSize ~/ Constants.blockSize),  random.nextInt(Constants.canvasSize ~/ Constants.blockSize));  } while (snake.pointOnSnake(food)); }  // In the snake class bool pointOnSnake(Point\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; point) {  for (Point body in snake) {  if (body == point) {  return true;  }  }  return false; }   Another interesting thing in the above code is snake[0] = Point((head.x + direction.x) % 50, (head.y + direction.y) % 50); this line is really interesting on how it handles negative x, y cases (read about mod with negative numbers).\n Controls We are pretty much done now, we just need to be able to control the snake, that’s it. I understand the chronology of this is a bit weird and we should have done this before the whole eat food logic, but having implemented the snake game quite a bit, I usually do this at the end.\nThis part doesn’t need much explanation, just two things are sufficient I guess:\n We are using RawKeyboardListener widget with autofocus set to true (so that we don’t have to tap it to take control). We’ll also define a keyHandler function to handle the events by the listener. (LogicalKeyboardKey is imported from flutter/services.dart) Two edge/additional cases I would like to address:  We don’t allow the snake to go in the direct opposite direction. We don’t call setState because regardless, it would be called within max 50 ms; We CAN call it but it won’t make much of a difference.    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57  void keyHandler(RawKeyEvent event) {  if (event.logicalKey == LogicalKeyboardKey.arrowDown) {  if (snake.direction != Constants.up) {  snake.direction = Constants.down;  }  } else if (event.logicalKey == LogicalKeyboardKey.arrowUp) {  if (snake.direction != Constants.down) {  snake.direction = Constants.up;  }  } else if (event.logicalKey == LogicalKeyboardKey.arrowRight) {  if (snake.direction != Constants.left) {  snake.direction = Constants.right;  }  } else if (event.logicalKey == LogicalKeyboardKey.arrowLeft) {  if (snake.direction != Constants.right) {  snake.direction = Constants.left;  }  } }  @override Widget build(BuildContext context) {  return RawKeyboardListener(  focusNode: FocusNode(),  onKey: keyHandler,  autofocus: true,  child: Container(  width: Constants.canvasSize,  height: Constants.canvasSize,  color: Colors.black,  child: Stack(  children: snake.snake // Update This  .map((e) =\u0026gt; Positioned(  top: Constants.blockSize * e.y,  left: Constants.blockSize * e.x,  child: Container(  height: Constants.blockSize,  width: Constants.blockSize,  color: Colors.green,  ),  ))  .toList() +  [  Positioned(  top: Constants.blockSize * food.y,  left: Constants.blockSize * food.x,  child: Container(  height: Constants.blockSize,  width: Constants.blockSize,  color: Colors.red,  ),  )  ],  ),  ),  ); }   Voila! Our game is ready. Try it below:\n Follow Ups  This implementation still has a few IO bugs which can lead to snake dying (hint: the way we load frames and update direction). We can use an input queue to fix that. Haven\u0026rsquo;t implemented score because it\u0026rsquo;s trivial for this game. This project is quite simple and probaly not blog worthy, but I wrote it anyways because, it was fun and I wanted an easy writeup to get out of my writing rut:) A good follow up project would be to implement a multiplayer version of this.

You had 3+1 hours to finish the exam and upload the answers, and that\u0026rsquo;s it (they didn\u0026rsquo;t care how you did it). Now for a lot of people, this would sound easy-peasy but for us lazy engineers who hadn\u0026rsquo;t handwritten anything for almost a year (due to the pandemic), it was a nightmare. We got through the exams though and during the last exam we thought that this process should be automated, we should be able to type out our handwriting.

Generated Font in Action\n  This was basically it, but building it was tough. Really tough. Me and Saksham brainstormed for hours, figured out Potrace and Fontforge libraries (not easy to deal with at all). Researched effective ways to extract out letters, deal with a lot edge cases. But ultimately, we did it, and published it to PyPi.\nNot going to explain much since we have documented it quite well, but below images gives a good understanding on what happens to a sample form:\n Extracting Letters\n   Conversion from PNG -\u0026gt; BMP -\u0026gt; SVG -\u0026gt; TTF\n  I learnt so much building handwrite, few key points:\n Anything you can imagine building in tech, is possible 99% of the times. Testing is very important, writing unit tests for Handwrite was really helpful in the later stages when we had to do major refactors. You can\u0026rsquo;t always do everything, collaboration is key. Solving problems around you make 10x better projects than regular UI clones. I discuss about Handwrite in every project based interview and interviewers always take so much interest!
