      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snake game is probably one of the most known video games in the world and I have built it multiple times, why? Because it’s a good intro project to any new language or framework. I have built it with Python, C++, Javascript, and Dart (Flutter). I frequently use it as an example when I’m teaching someone the basics of a language/framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we’ll build the Snake Game with Flutter. Some interesting things we’ll cover:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Working with Flutter on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most developers prefer to use Linux or MacOS for development and the major reason in simple terms is the &lt;strong&gt;terminal&lt;/strong&gt; and the ease they provide with their development environments. Windows has always been avoided by most developers (as far as I see in the community) but recently, after the announcement of Windows terminal and the increasing popularity of Windows Subsytem for Linux, many people have taken a stab at developing with Windows without having to install a Linux distro or use a Virtual Machine or in extreme cases, buy Macbooks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
