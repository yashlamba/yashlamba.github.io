      <description>Most developers prefer to use Linux or MacOS for development and the major reason in simple terms is the terminal and the ease they provide with their development environments. Windows has always been avoided by most developers (as far as I see in the community) but recently, after the announcement of Windows terminal and the increasing popularity of Windows Subsytem for Linux, many people have taken a stab at developing with Windows without having to install a Linux distro or use a Virtual Machine or in extreme cases, buy Macbooks.</description>

      <description>Hi, here&amp;rsquo;s a little about me.
Interests I love solving problems be it related to programming, mathematics or any field that interests me. I am an experienced Python, C++ and Flutter developer but can transition to any programming language easily. I constantly explore new stacks, ideas and reflect them in projects. I am really passionate about teaching higher mathematics and programming.
Current   Student at Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi pursuing Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in Technology with major Information Technology and minor Systems Biology.</description>
