      <description>Most developers prefer to use Linux or MacOS for development and the major reason in simple terms is the terminal and the ease they provide with their development environments. Windows has always been avoided by most developers (as far as I see in the community) but recently, after the announcement of Windows terminal and the increasing popularity of Windows Subsytem for Linux, many people have taken a stab at developing with Windows without having to install a Linux distro or use a Virtual Machine or in extreme cases, buy Macbooks.</description>

      <description>Hi, here&amp;rsquo;s a little about me.
Interests I am a full-stack developer experienced with multiple tech stacks and am quite interested in backend architecture, design, scaling and cloud. I personally believe that good programmers are never limited by the tech stacks they have in memory but how well they can understand, learn and develop new things! I always find myself in situations where I know the most complicated stuff but end up Googling the simplest things and that is how development works.</description>
